#summary Notes and Disclaimers to this Program.

= Notes =

 * The machine simulated by this program is not really a TM, since it has a finite tape. (~~In fact, there are only 10,000 tape squares.~~ The newer versions use a linked list to represent the tape, and the amount of tape squares is therefore limited only by the system's available memory.) However, this is sufficient for demonstration purposes, and physical limitations make it impossible to implement a true TM.

 * A real TM would have specific sets of tape alphabet and input alphabet. The machine simulated by this program does not limit any of the two, although ~~the letter 'B'~~ the character '_' (underscore) is used as blank symbol and cannot be used on the input tape.

 * This program is licensed under GPL v3. You are very welcome to improve and publish this program under the terms of that license.
